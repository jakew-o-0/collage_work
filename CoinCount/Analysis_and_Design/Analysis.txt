To validate the data, the program should check the expected weight of the bag,
depending on coin type, aginst the bags inputted weight. the expected weight
of the bag will be the weight of each singular coin, of a specific coin type,
multiplied by the number of each coin needed to make up the expected value of
a bag. For example, a bag of 2 pound coins should have a value of 20 pounds
-so 10 coins- and the weight of each coin is 12g. so, the expected weight is
120g.

For inacurate weights I will assume that the bag will always be of the same
type. To check by how many coins the bag is out the program will do:
incorect bag weight / weight of each coin	
--inorder to find the number of coins in the bag
expected number of coins - actual number of coins 
--to find the number of coins that shouldn't be there

All inputed data should be writen and read from a text document
for the coinCount.txt file, that contains all the user input data(name, total
bags, accuracy), a list of dictionaries could be used because it is then
explicitaly layed out in the text file on whow to be interpreted. this allows
for a new volenteer to be apended onto the end and old ones to be updated.
eg:
[{name:"jake", total:10, correctBags:5, accuracy:"50%"},
 {name:"bob", total 5:, correctBags:1, accuracy:"20%"}]
